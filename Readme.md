# Stock Analysis Tool

This tool is designed to fetch historical stock data, calculate moving averages, generate trading signals based on these averages, and visualize the results.

## Dependencies

The tool uses the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas_datareader

## How it works

1. **Fetch Historical Stock Data**: The tool uses Yahoo Finance to fetch historical data for a particular stock. In the provided example, it fetches data for Apple (symbol 'AAPL') from '2020-01-01' to '2021-01-01'.

2. **Calculate Moving Averages**: The tool calculates a short-term (40 days in the example) and a long-term (100 days in the example) moving average of the stock's closing prices.

3. **Generate Trading Signals**: The tool generates a trading signal when the short-term moving average crosses the long-term moving average. A buy signal is generated when the short-term average is greater than the long-term average, and a sell signal is generated when the short-term average is less than the long-term average.

4. **Plotting the Strategy**: The tool plots the stock's closing prices, the short-term and long-term moving averages, and the buy/sell signals. Buy signals are marked with green up-pointing triangles, and sell signals are marked with red down-pointing triangles.

## Usage

To use the tool, simply run the script. You can modify the `stock_symbol`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `short_window`, and `long_window` variables to analyze different stocks or time periods, or to use different moving average lengths.

## Output

The tool outputs a plot showing the stock's closing prices, the moving averages, and the buy/sell signals. This plot can be used to visualize the performance of the trading strategy based on moving averages.
